<!--
1. script put into <head> tag
    fetching and excuting js is blocking html parsing
2. script put into <body> tag,
    Page is ready before fetching, but interaction between js is too slow
3. script put into <head> tag with "async"
    js fetching is loaded parallely with parsing.
    but excuting js is blocking parsing parsing html

4. script put into <head> tag with "defer"
    js fetching is loaded parallely with parsing.
    and page is ready first and then excuting js.

--- script put into the <head> tag with "defer" is the best practice
